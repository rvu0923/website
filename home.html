                                <p> I am from Indianapolis Indiana. I was born on September 23rd, 2003 to my two loving parents.
                                I chose to attend IU to origianlly study at the Kelley School of Business but changed to informatics
                                out of interest. In my free time I am either doing homework for classes, eating, or playing basketball
                                with my friends. 
                                </p>
                                <p> I want to study the field of informatics because I like to work with technology. Growing up, I have
                                    always been tech savy and it never occured to me until my first year of college that I wanted to pursue a 
                                    career in this field. Subjects like computer science and computer engineering really fascinate me because of
                                    the work that goes in behind the scenes. More information can be found with the link to my resume below

                                <p> Here on the left is a shoe magazine that I created when I was in high school.
                                    Although it was long ago, I created this when I took a marketing class and it 
                                    was something I spent a lot of time on but found it fun to do. I used a website
                                    called <a href="https://www.canva.com" class ="canva">canva</a> and it made the process
                                    of creating this magazine very easy. If you would like to see more, you can click

                            <p>This project on the left is one that I did for an assignment that was highlighting an underrepresented individual
                            in STEM. The person shown is Clarrence 'Skip' Ellis and I chose him for this social media campaign because of his
                            significance in computer science. He was the first African-American to receive a degree in computer science marking a huge 
                            achievement in diversity within the underrepresented groups of Stem. Although this was an assignment, I found it fun to do
                            with the same reasons as the project above. The webiste used to create this was <a href="https://www.canva.com" class ="canva2">canva</a> 
                            which made the process a lot easier.</p>
